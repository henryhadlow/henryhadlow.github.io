    <p>
      I’m currently working on GOV.UK Notify. We’re making it easy for government services to keep users up-to-date with text messages, emails and letters. For instance, if you send in your passport as part of your student loan application, we’ll text you to say we’ve got it. Currently millions of people call government to check up on this kind of thing &ndash; this costs them time, and government money.

    <p>
      I also designed and currently manage <a href="petition.parliament.uk">petition.parliament.uk</a>. In the first 6 months, the site has resulted in <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/#petitions-with-debated-outcome">17 debates in the House of Commons</a>, on issues like refugees and immigration, junior doctors’ contracts, legalisation of cannabis and whether to ban Donald Trump from the UK. The site has handled over <abbr title="7 million">7m</abbr> signatures and been used by more than one in ten adults in the UK.

    <h3>Government Digital Service &ndash; lead&nbsp;designer</h3>
    <p class="experience-dates">August 2012&#8202;&ndash;&#8202;June 2015</p>

    <p>
      I worked on the launch of GOV.UK. We created one place for all government services and information, won Design of the Year 2013 and a D&amp;AD Black Pencil. GOV.UK costs £100m less each year than the websites it replaced, and 300 departments and agencies now have web pages that work the same way.

    <p>
      I also worked to simplify applying for a Lasting Power of Attorney. Previously, most people paid a lawyer £1,000+ to prepare their LPA, and even so, around 20% of LPAs had legal errors that made them unusable. The process is much simpler now. Most people make their LPA themselves, and even without a lawyers, only 1% of LPAs have legal errors. This is because I looked exhaustively at all the errors people make and designed them out.

    <h3>s[edition] &ndash; lead&nbsp;designer</h3>
    <p class="experience-dates">August 2011&#8202;&ndash;&#8202;May 2012</p>

    <p>
      Artists such as Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin typically sell limited edition works in small numbers, for large sums money. s[edition] flips that model on it’s head. Works are sold in much larger editions but for small sums, making art affordable for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      We worked with leading artists including Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, as well as digital art heavyweights including Rafael Rozendaal and Universal Everything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working with renowned graphic designer Jonathan Barnbrook, I created a visual identity that worked for art-world and digital audiences. Whilst other startups were still doing web-2.0-style designs, we were forging ahead with a simple, modern look designed to bring the artworks to the fore.

    <h3>The Partners</a> &ndash; designer</h3>
    <p class="experience-dates">July 2010&#8202;&ndash;&#8202;August 2011</p>

    <p>
      I worked for a large insulin brand, producing materials explaining how and when to prescribe the insulin. I was briefed to produce a book for employees  to help them navigate an enormous library of material: scientific studies, literature reviews and video tutorials for patients. I suggested an app &ndash; it automatically stays up-to-date, and you can email material to doctors right from within the app. The client loved it and it got The Partners loads more work.

    <p>
      I also worked pro-bono on a fundraising campaign for Richard House Children’s Hospice. We asked over a hundred professional illustrators to play a giant game of consequences, then created a website where you can mix and match their illustrations to create your own combination, which you can buy, as long as nobody else has beaten you to it!
